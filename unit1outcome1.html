    <h1>Unit 1 - outcome 1</h1>
    <h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business:</h3>
    <p>To cover the term IT, most people thing of it as Computers or computer networking.
    IT covers the spectrum of an organisations systems: Hardware, OS, Storage Systems, Apps, Databases, Storage, Servers, and even company phones are assets included in a business infrastructure.
    Information Technology, to use the proper term, has become a completely engraved facet of modern life, and consequently extends to almost every successful business; 
    Builders, Housing Associations, Refurbisher, Restaurants, Banks, Universities and educational institutes, The government; Basically everyone with a large professional body and structure 
    has IT as part of it’s sphere, and as specified in the first portion iT will handle the respective aspects of these companies.
    </p>
    <p>For a more specific example, IT’s purpose at Codenation is to provide the resources and platform for students and tutors to develop assets in order to improve the understanding of implementing coding, 
        Bug fixing, App and Web designing, and information writing with presentation creation. 
        Everything we do here besides signup is with a computer. 
        There are of course the back end sides of this too, senior and head staff using IT for organising meetings, business transactions, company overviews and performance results, etc.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>1.2  - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h3>
    <p>The first answer to this question is resources. It can’t be stressed enough how far resourcing and finding information out ahead of time will go towards saving you when the going gets tough. 
    You get project briefs with specific terms on them? Pull up info on how to put those terms into effect. You need Information on how to overcome a bug you’ve encountered whilst trying to develop a product for a project? 
    Hit up a forum tailored to what you’re using to find out if other users have had the problem and see best how to circumvent your issue.
    </p>
    <p>Second is an effective understanding of how at least to browse and navigate through the basic areas of a system. 
    Not understanding how to enter syntax into a terminal (outside of codenation) isn’t necessary but naturally problems will arise if you don’t understand how or where to save and find your files. 
    When using new technology too, it’s always helpful to hit the “help” option of an application if you find yourself stuck when wanting to do a specific thing. 
    Barring that sourcing from information books and magazines can be a life saver in the event of a catastrophic internet failure if you still have the means to access and do work.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?</h3>
    <p>My initial plan is to look at websites that offers a clean aesthetic, as well as websites with content relevant to what I’ll be typing in this project, 
    or at least has a close approximation in order to get the design right.
    </p>
    <p>Some other <b>tasks</b> will involve acquiring an appropriate colour scheme and font type to use with the final build, which will be placed on a separate sheet than the mind map. 
    The mind map itself will be more inherently focussed on pathing rather than looking good itself, although that would be a nice bonus for presentation upon submission.</p>
    <p>Other <b>plans</b> will involve learning some facets of implementation ahead of time, animation and sound design being the key ones, though these are of a lesser importance than just getting 
    the page layout and aesthetics down.</p>
