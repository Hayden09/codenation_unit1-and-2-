    <h1>Unit 1 - outcome 1</h1>
    <h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business:</h3>
    <p class="Paragraph">To cover the term IT, most people thing of it as Computers or computer networking.
    IT covers the spectrum of an organisations systems: Hardware, OS, Storage Systems, Apps, Databases, Storage, Servers, and even company phones are assets included in a business infrastructure.
    Information Technology, to use the proper term, has become a completely engraved facet of modern life, and consequently extends to almost every successful business; 
    Builders, Housing Associations, Refurbisher, Restaurants, Banks, Universities and educational institutes, The government; Basically everyone with a large professional body and structure 
    has IT as part of it’s sphere, and as specified in the first portion iT will handle the respective aspects of these companies.
    </p>
    <p class="Paragraph">For a more specific example, IT’s purpose at Codenation is to provide the resources and platform for students and tutors to develop assets in order to improve the understanding of implementing coding, 
        Bug fixing, App and Web designing, and information writing with presentation creation. 
        Everything we do here besides signup is with a computer. 
        There are of course the back end sides of this too, senior and head staff using IT for organising meetings, business transactions, company overviews and performance results, etc.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>1.2  - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h3>
    <p class="Paragraph">The first answer to this question is resources. It can’t be stressed enough how far resourcing and finding information out ahead of time will go towards saving you when the going gets tough. 
    You get project briefs with specific terms on them? Pull up info on how to put those terms into effect. You need Information on how to overcome a bug you’ve encountered whilst trying to develop a product for a project? 
    Hit up a forum tailored to what you’re using to find out if other users have had the problem and see best how to circumvent your issue.
    </p>
    <p class="Paragraph">Second is an effective understanding of how at least to browse and navigate through the basic areas of a system. 
    Not understanding how to enter syntax into a terminal (outside of codenation) isn’t necessary but naturally problems will arise if you don’t understand how or where to save and find your files. 
    When using new technology too, it’s always helpful to hit the “help” option of an application if you find yourself stuck when wanting to do a specific thing. 
    Barring that sourcing from information books and magazines can be a life saver in the event of a catastrophic internet failure if you still have the means to access and do work.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?</h3>
    <p class="Paragraph">My initial plan is to look at websites that offers a clean aesthetic, as well as websites with content relevant to what I’ll be typing in this project, 
    or at least has a close approximation in order to get the design right.
    </p>
    <p class="Paragraph">Some other <b>tasks</b> will involve acquiring an appropriate colour scheme and font type to use with the final build, which will be placed on a separate sheet than the mind map. 
    The mind map itself will be more inherently focussed on pathing rather than looking good itself, although that would be a nice bonus for presentation upon submission.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph">Other <b>plans</b> will involve learning some facets of implementation ahead of time, animation and sound design being the key ones, though these are of a lesser importance than just getting 
    the page layout and aesthetics down.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3>
    <p class="Paragraph">Lack of cohesion, and this can apply to a number of areas from the actual plan all the way to presentation. In terms of group projects communication is paramount in order to make sure one vision is applied to a project. 
    Getting bogged down by 40 different ideas being implemented outside of the first one or two planning sessions will on serve to distract at best with the focus on developing them, to frustrating 
    and damaging the development process such as breaking elements of a project and causing general stress and demotivation, reducing the developers effectiveness at performing.
    Saving project files incorrectly will also cause issues, which should be noted if you’re the kind of person who does submissions last minute.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph">External problems that can cause a project to become impacted can be funding. If a third party has a client pull the rug out from under them, then that automatically kills months of work and could potentially 
    really harm a business if they were riding on the projects funding (With said funding being provided in chunks). There’s also the unfortunate element of server and system failures when work hasn’t been saved, or the building 
    where a project is hosted is rendered temporarily inaccessible for any reason. It’s important to have a backlog or separate catalogue of what work has been created, but it’s paramount to ensure it’s secure, 
    as one of the biggest external dangers to a projects development (especially if said project has been collaboratively done entirely through an online resource) it’s malicious third parties sabotaging the work, 
    stealing or removing files that are vital to completion.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>
    <p class="Paragraph">One of the first things I would actually do aside from the prerequisite google search is hit up Linkedin, Linkedin is an effective resource for looking up businesses that specialise in certain areas, 
    as well as finding employees specifically. Getting in contact who’ve worked within the industry you’re looking to set your resources up for is probably a sensible route to try and go down. Of course this is a gamble, 
    so knowing exactly what you want to achieve first and potentially finding things out yourself via searches for text documents and video presentations would be an effective way to get started.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph">The next step would be to look into the ratings that a product has gotten when you think it might be a good choice to use when beginning setup. When it comes to web hosting you want to be able to make sure your page 
    is as secure as possible in order to mitigate hacking attempts and information theft. It’s pretty incredible to see what can be gleaned with a simple “inspect element” command.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph">Depending on what’s discussed in Unit 2 for this course will effectively dictate how my own website is hosted, but I’m hoping to include some extra elements of my own devising that will be included - hosting 
    them effectively without nuking the site would be nice though.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h3>
    <p class="Paragraph">I think first it’s worth outlining that when working in a team project we probably haven’t gone into all that much depth with utilising trello’s features than we could have. All information was entered manually 
    and notifications were used whenever an update was made but other aspects such as trello bot effectively fell by the way side after they were placed into the third party program (Slack). It actually seemed country 
    productive to use slack bot since in the time it would take to format the information in slack for the trello bot to take and use, we could just as easily look in the browser and type and format the information ourselves 
    in the same amount of time without any inherent issues.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph">Trello however, has been really quite helpful for the purposes of listing the chronological order of when tasks where set in place, tackled, and completed: On a day by day basis we’ve had a 
    physical meeting before combining our meetings agreements into a day’s to do list, with the elements added thereafter pertaining to the relevant module and the tasks presented on that to-to list. Most importantly in a simple, 
    concise format. Using colour coding also helped our team keep track of which days a project began (as well as which days some aspects of a module carried over to).</p>
    <p class="Paragraph">Moving onto Git Hub, I believe the uploading will be the perfect way to present the projects more technical elements. The only thing I need to be 100% sure of is that everything is labelled correctly. 
    Module and unit names and numbers etc. Once that’s done I think codes control can be done by simply looking up the file based on it’s unit. Adding A, B, C  or something of that effect to differentiate file versions might also help.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
    <p class="Paragraph">Ignorance of copyright law is a surefire way to have your project obliterated before your eyes. When producing your project the basics are in order: make it legally distinct. 
    Regardless of if it’s your own idea or whether you’re really wanting to copy another idea, if it’s not legally it’s own you’ll be faced with cease and desist notices and potential lawsuits.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph">Another law to consider is GDPR (known in some cases as data protection and failure to comply with it’s guidelines is a sure-fire way of being fined. To quote the EGNYTE page: 
    <i>“Under GDPR, EU citizens may submit a Subject Access Request (SAR) to find out which Personally Identifiable Information (PII) a company has about them.”</i>, this means if your own project involves storing people’s 
    information then you have to comply with a customer or persons request to give them all the information that you have on them, and more importantly to comply with any requests to remove their information from your systems. 
    There should always be a legally binding “opt out” option for a customer to select if you happen to require their personal information for anything. Even if it’s as simple as hosting their pictures on an app you’ve made, 
    you should never have legal permission to keep those things forever unless the work has been made for you and you’ve paid for it, and signed a contract stating that said images fall under your assets and you can do with them 
    how you please (Although this is getting into a whole other type of sphere).</p>
    <p class="Paragraph">Data protection as a term also covers the obvious, if you have someones information, take every measure possible to ensure that information is safe, secure, and only truly accessible within the company itself. 
    Data leaks can be catastrophic, and publicly air anything from phone numbers, emails, passwords, to the biggest of issues like bank account information.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph">There’s also the computer fraud and abuse act to consider when working on a project, CFAA is generally targeted towards hackers who are involved with data theft, but failure to declare what information you’re accessing 
    when working with people is guaranteed to have them come after you. So in a sense this law ties in with GDPR. Declare what information you’re going to take, and always have an opt out option.</p>
