    <h1>Welcome to my site - home of my final codenation project</h1>
    <h2>This page is part of Unit 2 - Outcome 1</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
    <p class="Paragraph">The idea for this website is to display the information I have been typing out in the unit projects. Unit 1 - Outcome 1, and Unit 2 - Outcome 1 will be presented on the website. To proceed from here my plan will be drafter visually with accompanying commentary here after.
    <b>[Post image of mind map here and provide text when the image is too small]</b>
    <ui class="Paragraphbullet">
    <li class="Paragraphbullet">Page 1: Introduction</li>
    <li class="Paragraphbullet">Page 2: Unit 1 - Outcome 1 text</li>
    <li class="Paragraphbullet">Page 3: Unit 2 - Outcome 1 text (which you're reading right now)</li> 
    <li class="Paragraphbullet">Page 4: Contact information</li>
    </ui>
    <P class="Paragraph">Each page will be one whole design with the entire body of the unit texts pasted within. The tricky part will come in making the final product look nice as well as adding the fancy features.
    Planned implements include:</P>
    <ui class="Paragraphbullet">
    <li class="Paragraphbullet">Paralax scrolling for certain backgrounds</li>
    <li class="Paragraphbullet">Header/ Banner load animation when transitioning between pages</li>
    <li class="Paragraphbullet">Background music</li>
    </ui>
    <P class="Paragraph">Other aspects to consider will be colour scheme. For this I intend to use the colour scheme I already use when branding my artwork, the SSDen logo and associated colours will be used along with a 
    “pop art” background, or if I have time and would rather do it; Flat illustrations that render well and work better on phones without being a battery drain then the gradients normally associated with my own brand.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
    <p class="Paragraph">As specified in Unit 1, not being careful with how you approach copyright is a good way of ensuring a project is swept out from under you, 
        and this includes websites. To understand copyright, we first need to understand intellectual property. To quote the GOV.uk article on intellectual 
        property and your work: </p><p class="Paragraph"><i>“Having the right type of intellectual property protection helps you to stop people stealing or copying: 
        the names of your products or brands, your inventions, the design or look of your products, & things you write, make or produce. Copyright, patents, 
        designs and trademarks are all types of intellectual property protection. You get some types of protection automatically, others you have to apply for.”</i></p>
    <p class="Paragraph">Copyright is one of these types you have to apply for, and the extent of its protection is so that it prevents people from (without your express consent), 
       copying your work, create derivatives from your work, Distribute copies of the work to the public or display them; pictorial, graphical, performance, or motion pictures, etc. 
       Publishing on behalf of or with permission of the original holder involves clearly labelling and marking all productions with the appropriate information, lest a legal dispute is opened.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph">In terms of a website this can generally mean the content itself is affected, Images, video files, & audio. Branding is, naturally, a facet of this and is the reason I’m intending to use images 
       I have made myself, or otherwise to implement royalty free stock photos as a placeholder. Site layout isn’t really affected however. On a technical level since there is basic coding 
       involved, laying out your website in the same way as someone else isn’t really an issue.</p>

    <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities 
        may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h3>
    <p class="Paragraph"> My first primary concerns for the browsing of a website would be visibility. 
            The first things I would like to ensure is that the font is clear and legible. Font size would be the easiest thing to attend to, and a font 
            similar to Arial would make sure the type face is easy to see and doesn’t blend together, dark-mode would also be a good choice if implementable for people who 
            have difficulty distinguishing dark letters on a bright background, white or otherwise. Greater challenges come in the form of colour blindness, whilst a font is manageable, making sure 
            the user has a better browsing experience is largely based around taste and good colour schemes. Having a green background would look unappealing to someone who 
            visually see’s green as a brown tone for example.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph"> It would be good for me to look up alternate palates to mitigate discomfort for colour blind users, hopefully in a catch all manner.
            One final thing I would consider would be a text to speech option for each body of text, but the implementation of this particular feature would probably prove a little time consuming; 
            Getting text to speech to read some words effectively can prove challenging due to the lack of nuance with phrases the voices can suffer from. Abbreviations are especially problematic, 
            with something such as “N.H.S” being vocally sounded as “N, full stop, H, full stop, S”.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph"> Something else to consider is overall site layout. Due to the number of pages we need to present in this project I don’t think this will be an issue but I want to ensure that the layout 
        and information provided on each page is contextualised and made as clear as possible; “The information provided here is part of Unit1” for example, if a paragraph such as my “About” me is 
        present on a page other than the one dedicated to the project units. </p>

    <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</h3>
    <p class="Paragraph">Webpages can host a variety of files to be downloaded, but items that actually display on a webpage are a different matter. 
       To get into the basics with images, most if not all websites can host image files; JPEG, GIF, & PNG, the inherent differences between JPEG and PNGs being the image quality, with JPEGs 
       loading faster on a webpage but being compressed in quality compared to PNG which offers a robust quality and consequently, a larger file size. 
       GIF itself can vary in terms of quality as it is a captured sequence of images that play in order – similar to a video without being as large as one and being much more 
       compressed in terms of quality.</p>
    <p class="Paragraph">Another visual file type is an SVG, which stands for Scalable Vector Graphic, which can be made multipurpose due to the vector never losing its level of quality when artificially 
        or manually shrunk or enlarged. The last type of visual based file format that we need to talk about is video. Video needs to specifically be hosted by a site, and in some instances 
        a site owner may choose to simply have the file presented as a downloadable, that said the types are: AVI, WMV, FLV, MOV, & MP4. 
        Typically, all these file types can be uploaded to a video hosting site such as YouTube, and then embedded in your website by using the appropriate HTML code when providing a link to it. 
        FLV is utilised in a lot of browser based plugins. </p>
    <p class="Paragraph">Audio files are also common for websites to host, whether it's for music or podcasts. Usually the format is either MP3 or WAV. Wav files are the format you want when you want to keep 
       the highest level of sound quality, but they also suffer the drawback of being large. MP3 operates in the opposite way, it’s a smaller file format but audio quality is unfortunately 
       compressed a little to compromise. </p>
