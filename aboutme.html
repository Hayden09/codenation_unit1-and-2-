            <p class="Paragraph">My name is Hayden Robinson, and I primarily operate as a hobbyist artist. 
              Code-nation appeared one day, with a presentation for an opportunity where people could go and try to unlock new potential within themselves and get involved in the coding world
              Due to wandering through life and struggling to find a role I was suitable for I decided to give them a shot, to see if I’d finally found something I could do, 
              I have an interest in basic website building, and though At the time of writing Javascript has proven to be a complicated program that I get stuck on frequently, 
              I’ve been given the resources to tackle the language with bolstered efficiency - I've also been involved in a group project that, whilst having teasing troubles, 
              has been a valuable reminder of what to do and how quickly to do it in a business based environment (even to an unofficial capacity in this case). 
              I also have some prior experience with website building, though this was nearly a decade ago, so the fresh start with codenation will prove fruitful in reawakening 
              anything I learned to do effectively back then.
              I'd also like to add that the staff here are pretty great, generally a likeable bunch and it's easy to see why they're successful and growing in my opinion.</p>
           
            <p class="Paragraph">To talk about myself: art is my passion. Rather than graphic design my specialty is concepting, 3d modelling and illustration. 
                I have a love of portraiture and telling a story with a face, as people are most often the most fascinating subjects to work with. 
                I’m able to work with digital painting and 3d modelling/ sculpting software, and have a passion for working with traditional media like graphite and ink. When not drawing or 
                having downtime with entertainment media, I enjoy going to places with plenty of greenery or city centres to get a taste of something different and take in the sights and sounds (smells are a mixed bag), 
                I enjoy any music with a good vibe, which means I can switch from anywhere between heavy metal, to jazz fusion, to synth pop at a moments notice.</p>
